# Jacobian-Question

Was the C1 correction computed incorrectly without the Jacobian?

After a lot of work it seems that it probably was. I still don't understand why I 
am now getting Scott's answer or what is wrong with my previous method. Let alone
how Scott got the answer he did the way that he says that he did it. I now get his
answer doing it his way (good) and my clearest way.

The Integration notebook shows how to compute the integral correctly using the
numeric method, compares this with Scott's version, and explains why you need
a Jacobian when performing a change of variables in an analytic integration
but NOT in a numeric integration.
